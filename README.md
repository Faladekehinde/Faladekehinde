## 🌟 About Me

Hello there! I'm an AWS Certified Solution Architech and currently a passionate learner in the **ALX Back-End Web Pro-Development** program. My journey into tech is fueled by a curiosity to understand how things work under the hood, and a drive to create solutions that matter.

🚀 My tech journey began with a focus on **AWS Cloud Architecture**, where I discovered the magic of scalable, secure, and efficient systems. What inspires me the most is the power of automation, infrastructure-as-code, and the potential of cloud-native applications to solve real-world problems.

🔍 Outside the code, I’m intrigued by the intersection of technology and impact—how smart architecture choices can lead to innovation in industries like education, health, and housing.
